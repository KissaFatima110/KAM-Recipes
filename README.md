##🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to design and develop a visually appealing and user-friendly *recipe and food blog website* using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*. The website aims to provide users with easy access to a variety of recipes from different cuisines, meal types, and food categories. It also allows users to view recipe details and save their favorite recipes for future reference. This project helps in understanding the practical implementation of front-end web technologies.

Users can mark their preferred recipes by clicking the heart icon displayed on each recipe card. This feature provides a simple and intuitive way to personalize the browsing experience, allowing users to quickly identify and return to their favorite dishes.

## Subscription And Social Engagement
At the bottom of the website, users can subscribe by entering their email address to receive the latest recipes and updates. Upon successful subscription, a confirmation popup appears with the message,  ensuring a smooth and reassuring user experience. Additionally, users can connect with the brand on Instagram by clicking the “Follow us on Instagram” link, fostering community engagement and extending the platform’s reach.

## Backend Functionality: Recipe Viewing and Email Delivery
This project’s backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and Nodemailer to power a recipe application. It enables users to instantly view complete recipe details when clicking the “View Recipe” button, and also provides the option to send their favorite recipes directly to their email for future access. Express.js manages the routes and request handling, while Nodemailer integrates with Gmail SMTP to deliver recipes in a professional format. Together, these technologies create a seamless experience that combines dynamic recipe viewing with reliable email delivery.
